# calculator_code
A simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
-->Problem Statement:
To create a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations and to Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
-->Code Explanation:
The script defines four functions:- add, subtract, multiply, and divide, each taking two parameters (a and b) and performing the corresponding mathematical operation.
->User Input:
Inside the loop, the user is prompted to select a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /).The user is then asked to enter two numbers (a and b) for the selected operation.
->Error Handling:
The script uses a try-except block to handle potential errors:
ValueError: If the user inputs a value that cannot be converted to a float (e.g., entering a non-numeric character).
ZeroDivisionError: If the user attempts to divide by zero.
Performing the Operation:
Depending on the selected operation, the script calls the appropriate function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) and prints the result.
->Continuation Prompt:
After each calculation, the user is asked whether they want to continue (choice = input("Continue (y/n)? ")).
-->Conclusion:
This code provides a basic calculator functionality with a simple command-line interface, allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It incorporates error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero. The loop structure allows the user to continue using the calculator until they choose to exit.
